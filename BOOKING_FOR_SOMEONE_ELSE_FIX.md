# 🔧 FIXED: "Booking for Someone Else" Not Saving Correctly

## The Problem

When you booked an appointment for someone else and verified with OTP, the appointment was being created with **your details** instead of the **other person's details**.

**What was happening:**
```
You: P-0001 (yehan)
Book for: John Doe (son), contact: 1234567890

After OTP verification:
❌ Appointment saved with: patient_code = P-0001
❌ No isBookingForSomeoneElse flag
❌ No otherPersonDetails
❌ Dentist saw: "yehan" (YOU) instead of "John Doe"
```

## Root Cause

**File:** `BACKEND/Controllers/AppointmentControllers.js`
**Function:** `verifyAppointmentOtp` (line 604)

The function was NOT reading the `bookingForSomeoneElse` and `otherPersonDetails` from the request body. It was only creating a basic appointment:

```javascript
// OLD CODE (WRONG):
const booking = {
  patient_code: payload.patient_code,  // Always used YOUR patient code
  dentist_code: payload.dentist_code,
  appointment_date: appointmentDate,
  reason: normalizeText(reason) || payload.reason || "",
  status: "pending",
};
// Missing: isBookingForSomeoneElse and otherPersonDetails!
```

## The Fix

Updated the `verifyAppointmentOtp` function to:

### 1. Read the Data from Request Body
```javascript
const { otpId, code, reason, bookingForSomeoneElse, otherPersonDetails } = req.body || {};
```

### 2. Get Booker's Patient Code
```javascript
const bookerPatientCode = req.user?.patientCode;
```

### 3. Handle "Booking for Someone Else" Logic
```javascript
// Handle "booking for someone else" from request body
if (bookingForSomeoneElse && otherPersonDetails) {
  // Validate other person's details
  if (!otherPersonDetails.name?.trim()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: "Other person's name is required" });
  }
  if (!otherPersonDetails.contact?.trim()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: "Other person's contact is required" });
  }

  booking.isBookingForSomeoneElse = true;
  booking.bookerPatientCode = bookerPatientCode;
  booking.otherPersonDetails = {
    name: otherPersonDetails.name.trim(),
    contact: otherPersonDetails.contact.trim(),
    age: otherPersonDetails.age ? parseInt(otherPersonDetails.age) : undefined,
    gender: otherPersonDetails.gender || '',
    relation: otherPersonDetails.relation?.trim() || '',
    notes: otherPersonDetails.notes?.trim() || ''
  };

  // Try to find if the other person is already a registered patient
  const existingPatient = await Patient.findOne({ 
    $or: [
      { phone: otherPersonDetails.contact.trim() },
      { email: otherPersonDetails.contact.trim() }
    ]
  }).lean();

  if (existingPatient) {
    booking.appointmentForPatientCode = existingPatient.patientCode;
  }
} else {
  // Regular booking for self
  booking.patient_code = bookerPatientCode;
}
```

## Now It Works Correctly

### When You Book for Someone Else:
```
You: P-0001 (yehan)
✓ Check "Book for someone else"
Fill: Name = "John Doe", Contact = "1234567890", Relation = "son"
Get OTP → Verify

✅ Appointment saved with:
✅ isBookingForSomeoneElse = true
✅ bookerPatientCode = "P-0001"
✅ otherPersonDetails = {
     name: "John Doe",
     contact: "1234567890",
     relation: "son",
     ...
   }
```

## Important Notes

### For Existing Appointments
⚠️ **Old appointments created before this fix won't have the "booking for someone else" data.**

Only NEW appointments created after this fix will show correctly.

### To Fix Old Appointments (Optional)
You can manually update them in MongoDB:
```javascript
db.appointmentmodels.updateOne(
  { appointmentCode: "AP-0062" },
  { 
    $set: {
      isBookingForSomeoneElse: true,
      bookerPatientCode: "P-0001",
      otherPersonDetails: {
        name: "John Doe",
        contact: "1234567890",
        age: 25,
        gender: "male",
        relation: "son",
        notes: ""
      }
    },
    $unset: { patient_code: "" }
  }
)
```
